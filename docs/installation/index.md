# Installation

## Overview
The RabbitMQ Helper is a tool that streamlines the RabbitMQ installation on Windows. Only versions of RabbitMQ/Erlang installed through the Thycotic Rabbit MQ Helper are directly supported. You can download Rabbit MQ Helper [here](https://updates.thycotic.net/links.ashx?RabbitMqInstaller). 

While the Helper has individual cmdlets that perform the different installation/un-installation steps, it also contains two workflow cmdlets called ```Install-Connector``` and ```Uninstall-Connector```.

## Installation Examples with Arguments

> The below links show the four main scenarios when installing RabbitMQ using the Rabbit Helper and how to deploy Rabbit in each scenario. Pick the link which applies to you for example commands
- [Simple installation of RabbitMQ without TLS from a computer connected to the Internet](installnontls.md)
- [Simple installation of RabbitMQ without TLS from a computer NOT connected to the Internet](installnontls-offline.md)
- [Advanced installation of RabbitMQ with TLS from a computer connected to the Internet](installtls.md)
- [Advanced installation of RabbitMQ with TLS from a computer NOT connected to the Internet](installtls-offline.md)

## How to Uninstall Rabbit

> This command will remove both RabbitMq and Erlang from the current system. Before running this, if you’re having issues with Rabbit, it’s recommended to look at the troubleshooting section first.
